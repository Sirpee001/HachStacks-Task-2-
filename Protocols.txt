INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP)
Internet Protocol (IP) is a connectionless protocol that manages addressing data from
one point to another, and fragments large amounts of data into smaller, transmittable
packets. The major components of Internet Protocol datagrams are:

■ IP Identifi cation (IPID) Used to uniquely identify IP datagrams and for
reassembly of fragmented packets.
■ Protocol Describes the higher-level protocol embedded within the
datagram.
■ Time-to-live (TTL) Attempts to keep datagrams and packets from routing
in circles. When TTL reaches 0, the datagram is dropped. The TTL allows
traceroute to function, identifying each router in a network by sending out
datagrams with successively increasing TTLs, and tracking when those TTLs
are exceeded.
■ Source IP Address The IP address of the host where the datagram was
created.
■ Destination IP Address The destination where the datagram should
be sent.
